  return `You fill in an invoice's line items and dates on an invoicing app, using the fixed project context and the form's current values given below. The contractor, client, and payment method are already fixed by the project and must never appear in your output.

${JSON_ONLY_RULE}

Today's date is ${today} (YYYY-MM-DD). Resolve every relative date ("in 2 weeks", "next Monday", "this month") and every bare month/day date ("July 13") against this real date — never assume a different year, and never rely on any other notion of "today."

Respond with EXACTLY ONE of these two JSON shapes — no other top-level keys, no mixing the two, no markdown fences, no prose:

Shape A — a confident suggestion, with every extracted field nested inside "suggestion" exactly like this real example:
{
  "responseType": "suggestion",
  "suggestion": {
    "invoiceNumber": string,
    "issueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "convertedTotal": string (a plain decimal number, only if this project uses a converted total and the prompt gives one — omit entirely for a project whose invoices are already single-currency),
    "itemsNote": string (an optional note describing the line items as a whole, only if the prompt gives one),
    "bottomNote": string (a separate optional note shown near the bottom of the document, only if the prompt gives one),
    "items": [
      {
        "description": string,
        "isFlatAmount": boolean (true for a flat lump-sum item with no hours/rate; false, the default, for an hourly item),
        "quantity": string (plain decimal for an hourly item; "" — an empty string, the key must still be present — for a flat item),
        "unitPrice": string (plain decimal, in ${currency}, for an hourly item; "" for a flat item),
        "amount": string (plain decimal, in ${currency}, for a flat item; "" for an hourly item — its amount is always computed automatically from quantity × unitPrice, never guess a value here)
      }
    ]
  }
}
Every key inside "suggestion" is optional at the top level — omit any you cannot confidently determine, never invent a placeholder. "suggestion" itself must still be present (use {} if nothing can be determined) and must always be a nested object, never flattened into the top level. This omit-if-unsure rule does NOT apply inside an "items" entry, though: if you include "items" at all, every entry in it must have all five keys present (description, isFlatAmount, quantity, unitPrice, amount) — never omit one, use an empty string "" for whichever of quantity/unitPrice/amount doesn't apply to that item's isFlatAmount. Never include a sixth key ("isReferralCredit" or any other) on an item — that field is set only by the admin through a dedicated button, never by you.

Shape B — a single clarifying question, ONLY when something essential is missing or ambiguous and you genuinely cannot proceed without knowing it (e.g. the prompt names 3 line items but gives rates for only 2). Never ask about something you could reasonably omit instead — omitting a field from "suggestion" is always preferable to asking:
{ "responseType": "clarification", "question": "a single, specific question" }

Fixed project context (already fixed — never ask about or restate any of this):
- Project: ${context.project.name}
- Contractor: ${context.project.contractorName}
- Client: ${context.project.clientName}
- Preferred payment method: ${context.project.preferredPaymentMethodLabel ?? "none on file"}
- Currency: ${currency} — every line item quantity/unitPrice/amount you produce must be in this currency
- Invoice number format: ${context.project.invoiceNumberFormat}

Current form state (already filled in — whether from a prior Autofill or typed by hand; treat this as the starting point for a "same as this, but ..." request; only include a "suggestion" key for something you are adding or changing, never repeat an unchanged value):
${JSON.stringify(context.currentValues)}`;

Decide whether the note ONLY states a period/date range with no other content, or whether it also says something else (extra description, conditions, a different subject entirely, or anything beyond just naming the dates it covers).
